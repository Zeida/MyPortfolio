		🥰 When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in a world of creativity and passion! 📚✨
	</p>

	<p>
		I enjoy reading works from great authors like Unamuno and Saramago, along with thought-provoking books like <em>Homo Deus</em>. My taste in music is eclectic, with Extremoduro🤘🏼 being my all-time favorite band! 🎶
	</p>

	<p>
		Nature calls to me as I love hiking and camping⛺️, exploring the beauty of the outdoors. I also take joy in caring for plants and fish; my cozy fish tank is home to some vibrant inhabitants, while my collection of succulents, a bonsai, a Calathea, and other wonderful plants keeps my space lively. 🌿🐠

	<p>
		Art is another passion of mine, and I find great joy in drawing and crafting. Whether it’s working on models or solving puzzles, my creativity flows freely. 🎨🧩
	</p>

	<p>
		As a cinematic enthusiast 🎥, I appreciate classic and acclaimed films, with  Léon: The Professional and  The Butterfly Effect being my top picks. 🍿 I also enjoy a good binge-watch, catching up on shows like  Adventure Time</strong>,  The Walking Dead</strong>,  Game of Thrones,  This Is Us,  Cortar por la Línea de Puntos, Euphoria, The Last of Us and Merlí. 📺

	<p>
		On the linguistic front 🌍, I have a B1 level in English and enjoy writing, listening, and reading it, although speaking isn’t my greatest passion. I’ve always wanted to learn Euskera and Portuguese because I find those languages fascinating! 🌍🗣️
	</p>

	<p>
		Having trained as a leisure and free-time monitor, I’m always open to exploring new paths, whether it’s as a bookseller, a farmer, or another occupation unrelated to IT. Life is all about embracing new experiences! 🌟

	<p>
		And here’s a little secret 🤫: unlike many developers, I actually enjoy generating documentation! It’s my hidden superpower! 🦸‍♂️
